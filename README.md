# Swift-Calculator
Code is based on Apple's -current- calculator and just for educational purposes to mostly to beginners as me (right now).

Only missig thinks are Home screen Haptic Touch feedback and swipe to delete last entered input on-display.

Code is developed for iOS 12, it has not got SwiftUI implementation.   

For credit I take round button class from "https://medium.com/@filswino/easiest-implementation-of-rounded-buttons-in-xcode-6627efe39f84".
